## Lecture 0 Introduction

*The core of AI is digitalize the real world*

### 1.Basic concepts

#### 1.1 The circle

Sensors -> (Function + Program) -> Actuator -> Actions -> Sensors

#### 1.2 Humanly and rationally

| thinking humanly          | acting humanly | thinking rationally        | acting rationally        |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Needs to understand minds | Turing tests   | needs to define rationally | same as the previous one |
> Rationality means maximize the excepted performance (because of uncertainty)
>
> knowledge base -> help to make decisions -> from known to unknown
>
> agent should gather information and learn from them, in order to be autonomous 

#### 1.3 3 levels of human brains' function

decision making -------- search （in limited choices）

inference ------- Logic reasoning

learning ------- machine learning
